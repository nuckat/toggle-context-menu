# toggle-context-menu
A `.bat` script I made to toggle between the legacy Windows 10 right-click context menu and the newer Windows 11 style. It also automatically restarts Windows Explorer so changes take effect immediately.

This is primarily a personal backup, but feel free to use it however you please. I am not responsible for your system
